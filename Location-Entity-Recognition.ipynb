Every day is throwing new light upon the great events of the past. From various causes, we are able to form a more accurate estimate of the trans- actions of our ancestors than those who immediately succeeded them. We can in spirit mingle with them, and from the increasing light which history is shedding upon the social and moral condition of many of those early breth- ren in this country of whom the world was not worthy, we can understand their difficulties, and more fully appre- ciate the noble triumphs many of them won. In few instances is this more remarkably the case than in that inter- esting company of Christian sufferers mentioned at the head of this paper. The detail in the pages of our historians is very brief; but, happily, more abun- dant materials are within our reach. All our writers concur in stating, that those brethren had fled from the Low Countries, to escape the misery to which the avowal of baptist principles exposed VOL. XIII.—FOURTH SERIES. them. We had to forsake our friends, saysoneofthesufferers,our country, our possessions, on account of tyranny, and fled as lambs from a wolf; only because of the pure evangelical truth of Christ, and not for uproars or factions sake, like those of Munster, whose views arc an abomination, of which we have been slanderously accused. Most of them settled in London, with the hope of protection, and for some time pursued their calling in peace. But this was of short continuance. Popery had altered only in name. Its spirit was rampant in episcopal bosoms, and history has given a full record of its fearful deeds. These simple-minded people soon felt its power. They had continued to meet for exhortation and prayer, and sought the edification of one another in the Lord. The morning of the sabbath had dawned, and these devoted servants of Christ sought their accustomed place of worship. Doubtless it was some retired house, or an upper room in which they\n\nPage 2\nTHE BAPTIST MARTYRS OF 1575. met for holy service. What elevated feelings would animate them! What a conflict between hope and fear! How pure, how tender, but how unearthly, the devotion of such a meeting! What a power of principle they would unfold! All the dignity of Christian manhood would be seen. They knew the power of suffering; they were prepared again to brave its fury, if necessary, for the truth. Imagination will realize more than this, as by an effort it tries to identify itself with this little band of Christian disciples. The hour of trial was at hand. It happened, says a deeply interested witness of their sub- sequent sufferings, on Easter, the 3rd of April, a.d. 1575,* that thirty ana- baptists, of both sexes, had assembled together in a house near Alligator,t on the road leading to Spicgelzhof, for the purpose of mutual exhortation and prayer; but, being detected by the neighbours, they were nearly all taken then to prison, by so small a guard that some could easily have escaped, if they could have felt liberty of conscience to do bo. Noble men! Even your mis- takes proclaim your greatness. The names of five of them are preserved. They deserve to be remembered. They were, John Pieters, Henry Terwoort, Garret Von Byler, John Von Straaton, and Christian Kernels. From the cus- tody of the sheriff they were soon transferred to the tender mercy of my lord of London. Their final examina- tion was at the episcopal palace. Igno- rant of their language, the bishop was assisted on this momentous occasion by a French and Dutch minister. Their reconciliation to the Dutch church, and the cure of their pestilential heresy, was the avowed end of this imposing procedure. The usual course was adopted here. Blandishment and • The lixteenth yoar of the reign of Queen Ellaboth —Ed. . . . t ildBg&to^ Fuller, «tarc!;IJljl. terror were mingled. The episcopal smile was first exhausted, and then came the terrible frown. These sturdy confessors were assured that their re- cantation would have the most health- ful influence upon the state of their souls, and be hailed as a special token of Gods great goodness by the whole church; whilst the alternative in this world would be banishment or death, and in the future hopeless misery. The following graphic description is from the pen of Von Byler himself, and will show us the nature of the charge upon which these holy men were tried, and throw a gleam of light upon the mode of their procedings. When we came before the bishop, there were present, Master Joris* James de Koninck, John de Rode- maker, two members of the council, and a French clergyman. We were placed before those lords, and their ser- vants, who propounded four questions to us, to which we were to give either an affirmative or a negative.  1. Whether Christ did not assume his flesh from the body of Mary V We replied, That he is the Son of the living God.  2. Whether infants should not be baptized V  We cannot understand matters so, for we read nothing of it in the scrip- tures.  Whether it was lawful for a Chris- tian to attend to, or discharge the duties of, a magistrates office V We replied, That our conscience would not suffer us to do so; but we considered the magistracy as a minister of God, for the protection of the ser- vants of God.  4. Whether a Christian was allow- ed to take an oath V We again replied, our conscience would not now allow us to do so, for • Probably the minister of the Dutch church.\n\nPage 3\nTHE BAPTIST MARTYRS OF 1575. 3 Christ said, Let your communications be yea. yea, nay, nay. We then kept silent The bishop said that our mis- deeds were very gross, and we could not inherit the kingdom of God, 0! Lord, ayenge not! The bishop then remand- ed us to prison. A young brother who was first interrogated, boldly confessed the truth; and was on that account sorely accused, and led to Westminster, where he was imprisoned by himself. This caused us much grief. Some additional information may be gathered from an interesting letter written by a countryman of these per- secuted saints, to his mother, then resi- dent at Ghent. She was a woman of great piety, and had requested her son to supply her with all the information he could procure. His name was Somers, a resident in London, a member of the Butch church there, and subse- quently, on his return to his native land, raised to the highest honours of the state.* It is probable, he says, that I am better acquainted with the circumstances than the generality of people, inasmuch as I have had frequent intercourse with them, and have re- ceived information from all of them: so I cannot forbear giving such an account of it as accords with the extent of my information in reference to the matter. In connexion with which, I send you a copy of their confession; on account of which some died, and others are retained in prison. We have given this, that our readers may see the trustworthiness of his narrative. On their return from their examina- tion to their place of confinement, Mr. Somers says, That ten or twelve of them made their escape, as they were aware of the danger to which they were exposed, and perceived the fine oppor- tunity of escape that presented itself; the guard consisted but of one or two * Benedicts HUtory of the Baptists, pp. 313, 314. individuals. The whole of them, how- ever, in the course of two or three days, returned to the prison, partly in order to acquit their bail, who were bound in the sum of £100, and partly because the bishop, as a man of honour, promis- ed with an oath, that he would set them all at liberty in the course of five or six days if they would return; but if not, the rest should remain in prison till Candlemas. The dreary solitude of their prison- house was soon disturbed by their officious opponents. Again and again they were visited by many Netherland- ers, and twice they were summoned into the august presence of the London pontiff. To one of these visits the fol- lowing extract refers,— When we were all lodged in prison, came Master Joris, and said, if we would join the church he would set us at liberty—for these are the bishops orders. But we con- tended valiantly for the truth in Christ Jesus—for he is our Captain and none else; upon him we put all our confi- dence.* These means, sooner or later to some extent, were successful. For soon  after this, five of the men were converted (through much disputation with these Netherlanders who belonged to the church) before they were con- demned as heretics; nevertheless, they were placed before a rostrum in St. Pauls Churchyard, in a large assembly of some thousands of Englishmen, and a bundle of faggots was laid upon each ones shoulder, as a sign that they de- served to be burnt. In addition to which they inflicted many other injuries and ignominy upon them, though the bishop had promised that he would set them at liberty without any incum- brances if they would only sign the four articles; but the event proved the contrary. This transpired the 25th of May, A.D., 1575.t * Bylers Letter. t Somersg Letter.\n\nPage 4\nTHE BAPTIST MARTYRS OF 1A75. The form of recantation may be seen in Crosby and Ivimey.* Both say it took place in the Dutch church, Austin Friars. But the account of Somers is the more probable, and is, moreover, confirmed by Fuller.t This partial success inspired the bishop and his Dutch colleagues with hope, and they renewed their efforts to win the remainder to their faith. For the fourth time they were called before the priestly tribunal. It was, says Von Byler, On Whitsuntide morning we were chained two and two, and led be- fore the lords. When we were brought before them, they presented the same four questions, urging us to subscribe to them; but we told them that we would abide by the word of the Lord. We were then remanded to prison, and fettered as before; the women were con- fined at Newgate, together with a young brother; but they were all released, and transported. The young man, however, was tied to a cart and scourged, and afterwards whipped out of town. The statement of Mr. Somers is rather fuller, and gives us an occasional glimpse of the tenderness with which episcopal hands dealt with their erring brethren. In the course of a few days, the bishop perceiving that the rest would not apostatize from their faith, sentenced them all to death in the ecclesiastical court-room, St. Pauls church (as was customary with the papistic bishops during queen Marys reign, who were wont to condemn the Christians to death), and deliver them into the hands of the civil judge; then they bound the women hand to hand, and conducted them to Newgate—the prison for capital convicts—together with one of the men which was considered the youngest and most innocent among them;but the rest of the men were conducted to their old » Crosby, i., CO. Ivimey, I, 103, 104. t Church Hist., Cent, xvi., 164. episcopal prison, for which reason it was supposed that the women would be executed first, even as persons came daily to threaten them, and to present death to them unless they would apos- tatize. Hence they suffered great an- guish and temptation for five or six days, supposing every day that they would be burnt; nay, on the very day that sentence of their banishment came from the court—for the bailiff came with his servant at ten oclock in the evening, unto the prison, to take an in- ventory of all their property, informing them, in addition, that they should pre- pare for death the next day. This he did, in order to see whether any of them would apostatize through fear; but perceiving that they all remained stedfast, he informed them that it was the queens pleasure to be gracious to them, and merely banish them from the country, and have the young men whip- ped behind a cart. Accordingly, in the course of five or six days, about fourteen women were conveyed from the prison, which is situated in the space between St. Martins church and St. Catherines, to the ship by the apparitors: but the young man was whipped behind a cart, which moved on before him. Thus they were all banished from the country, on pain of imprisonment, and reside for the present in Holland and Zealand. A few days after, the five men that remained in the bishops prison were likewise sentenced to death by the bishop, and conveyed to Newgate, where one of them died of wretchedness and a load of chains; and the rest were apprehensive that they would inflict ex- treme punishment upon them, because they had exercised so much severity upon the women. They were also in- formed that the queen and her whole council were so highly offended at them that no person would venture to present a petition for them, since an evil report arose, that they denied God and Christ,\n\nPage 5\nTHE BAPTIST MARTYRS OF 1575. and rejected all government and all re- spect for the magistrate and civil power, as ungodly and unchristian. Efforts, nevertheless, were made to obtain their freedom. A petition and confession of their faith were presented to her majesty; but that cruel and haughty sovereign refused to listen to it, and indignantly reprimanded those through whose influence it had been laid before her. Failing in this, they laid them before the bishop, through a noble lord, he graciously conde- scended to tell them how distressed he was on their account; but there was no hope of favour unless they would sign the four articles, and abjure their here- sy. Hypocrisy is hateful in any form, but it is most hideous when associated with the cant of religion as seen in this pretended successor of the apostles. The substance of this confession we have, doubtless, in a document prepared by the two martyrs, as a vindication of themselves. We select a few sentences from it, and our readers will see what it was his lordship of London condemn- ed as heresy, and for the defence of which the writers were burnt at the stake. We poor and despised strangers who are persecuted for the testimony of Jesus, desire that God may grant all mankind peace, so that they may live together in all godliness to the praise of the Lord, and to the advancement of their souls salvation. Since so many, both by writing and verbal statement, do us great injustice, accusing and charging lies upon us, I am constrained to present our belief very summarily. They do not speak to us, and do not, in a mild manner, inquire of us what our religious views are, as the scriptures teach; but they speak all manner of evil of us, so that they increase our miseries and sufferings; and, besides, they have no compassion either on our distressed wives or helpless children. We seek no salvation in our works, as it is reported we do, but we hope to be saved alone through the merits of our Lord Christ. Nor do we boast that we are without sin, but we always con- fess ourselves sinners before God. But we have to refrain from voluntary sins if we would be saved; such as adultery, fornication, sorcery, sedition, bloodshed, cursing and swearing, lying and cheat- ing, pride, drunkenness, hatred, envy; these are the sins that the scriptures declare, who do them shall not inherit the kingdom of God. They also say, we refuse to hear the word of God because we do not go to hear the preachers of the church. To this charge we would say,that we do not hear the preachers is, because the word of God constrains to do so; because they are people not fit to attend to the Bacred callings of a gospel preacher, for Paul teaches Timothy and says, The things thou hast heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, &c. Now if the preachers were such as the apostle re- quired, we would cheerfully hear them —we would be the first and last in church. . . . We are also accused of not being subject to the magistracy, because we do not baptize infants. To this we reply, we desire to submit to the magistracy in all things not contrary to the word of God. That we do not suffer our chil- dren to be baptized by the priests, is not done out of temerity, but we do it out of fear to God, because Christ commands believers to be baptized; for Christs apostles did not baptize infants but adults only, and those on their faith and confessions of their sins. . . . If it had been the will of God that infants should be baptized, he would have com- manded it to be done. Christ would have been baptized in his infancy, as well as circumcised; but as it is not the will of God, therefore did he teach th«m\n\nPage 6\nTHE BAPTIST MARTYRS OP 1575. differently, and received baptism differ- ently himself. . . . The German and French ministers having failed in their disputations to convince them of their errors,* and the efforts of many, both German and English, amongst whom was the cele- brated John Fox,t who addressed a letter to the queen on their behalf, proving abortive, preparation was made for executing the diabolical sentence. Orders were issued, says Somers, from the court to the sheriff or bailiff of London, to execute the two oldest, according to their sentence. One of whom, Jan Pieters, was a poor man, upwards of fifty years old, and had nine children. His first wife was previously burnt at Ghent in Flanders, on account of her religion, and he had married a second wife, whose first husband had likewise been burnt at Ghent for his re- ligious principles. But these two had fled into England on account of perse- cution, on supposition that they could live there and enjoy liberty of conscience without being exposed to any danger; which circumstanoe he represented to the bishop, and desired the favour of removing from the country with his wife and children, but he could not ob- tain it. The other, called Henry Ter- woort, was a handsome and respectable man, twenty-five or twenty-six years old; a goldsmith by trade, and had been married eight or ten weeks before he was apprehended. On Tuesday, the 19th of July, the work of preparation for this attfo-da-fi was commenced in Smithfield. The scenes which had been so familiar in the last reign, were about to be reacted. The massy stake soon rose in the midst, whilst the chain, heaps of faggots, and other materials, proclaimed to the passers-by that the horrid work of death was at hand. Early in the morn- ing of Friday, the prisoners were visited by the officers of blood. The morning light had scarcely scattered the last re- mains of darkness, as they left their gloomy cell for ever. Pieters, as he was led in his manacles, said to those around him,  This is the way the pro- phets went, and Christ our Saviour, which was the case ever since the days of Abel.* It was scarcely six oclock, when these noble confessors, being fastened to the stake, were miserably burnt to ashes, without having been strangled, and without powder, accord- ing to the custom at Smithfield, where they used to burn the people who pro- fessed our religion.t The unhappy fate of these good men had no unfavour- able influence upon their companions still in prison. They continued firm and stedfast, with the daily expectation of submitting to the same punishment. Luke and I endeavoured, if possible, to get them out of prison four days after the execution of the others; we even prevailed upon them, through much conversation, to sign the confes- sion, in the hope that the bishop would be satisfied with it. Having read it he found it good throughout; but he will not receive them into favour unless they sign the first four articles without contradiction, and join the Dutch church; which they are determined not to do, even if they perfectly agree with us in doctrine; since thereby they would condemn those that had been executed, and all the rest of their comrades who died or still live in the same faith, and would confess that they had been seduc- ed by the devil, the spirit of lies and error, to this damnable heresy, of which they declare that they are by no means convinced in their own consciences, but that they are much more assured of * Somers. t Vide iTlmej, to!. * Bjlcr. + lb.\n\nPage 7\nTIIE WANTS OF THE CHURCH FOR THE NEW YEAR. their salvation in Christ, the very God and very Man; they would, therefore, as they say, provoke Ood in the highest, if they should speak contrary to the testimony of their own consciences. Hence we know of nothing else than that they will have to suffer the same punishment that was endured by their partners, the more especially as they attempted to break out of prison, hav- ing filed off an iron bar of the window, for which cause they are kept more closely in bonds than at any former time, and may consider themselves fortunate if an early and preferable death should release them from the great distress and misery of the prison—for they lie sepa- rate from each other, so that they can- not afford each other any consolation, and no one dare converse with them, on the pain of immediate imprisonment.* I will only add to this somewhat lengthy detail, that one of the prisoners, Kernels, met his fate during his con- finement in his damp and gloomy cell; but that happily the others, after a somewhat lengthy confinement, were permitted to breathe the air of liberty. An ample detail of these proceedings will be found in the Dutch Martyrology, a copy of which, we hope, will speedily be in the hands of most of our readers. It will be found to throw much light on many points of our early history, and should be read by all anxious to form a correct estimate of men, who have nobly prepared the way for us. Excuse this closing allusion. Scarborough, Nov. 6. THE WANTS OF THE CHURCH FOR THE NEW YEAR. BT THE REV. CORNELIUS ELVEN. At the commencement of the new year it may not be unwise for the church to take an inventory of its wants. The old divines were wont to deal in negatives and positives, and without imitating all their quaint formalities, albeit there were giants in those days, we may be permitted for once to follow in the well-beaten track, by attempting to show that there are three things which we do not want, and three which we do want. Not that these are all that might be adduced, but they are submitted as suggestive, leaving it to thoughtful readers to amplify for their own edification, and the advancement of the cause of Christ. I. We do not want a new bible. Many an old volume of human lore has been rendered obsolete by the dis- coveries of a succeeding age. But all true science does homage to the bible. We need not be apprehensive that the ever-widening sphere of human litera- ture will intrench on the hallowed ground of divine revelation. We have now no misgivings lest light from that region of nebulae — the milky way— should extinguish the beams of the Sun of Righteousness; or lest the chemistry of the stars should dis- turb the harmonious elements of inspi- ration. Standing on the Rock of Ages, we are conscious of no tremor from the hammer of the geologist; nor do we fear that the hieroglyphics of the archae- ologist may invalidate the chronology of Moses. Exempt from the mutations which pertain to mere human philosophy, the bible, stereotyped from heaven, remains alike the glory of all lands and of all\n\nPage 8\n8 THE WANTS OF THE CHURCH FOR THE NEW YEAR. times. Christians, be intreated, with the new year, to address yourselves with new and prayerful affection to that sacred volume which alone can make you wise unto salvation. Moat wondrous book! bright candle of the Lord! Star of eternity! the only star By which the bark of man could navigate The sea of life, and gain the coast of bliss. Neither do we want a new ministry.— This, indeed, may be numbered among our perils. We deprecate the attempt to transform the pulpit into a chair of philosophy and to substitute the essay for the sermon. It is quite true that the Christian ministry should seek to keep abreast with the age, and that the preacher should set as high an estimate on knowledge as the lecturer. But we must not extol reason at the expence of revelation, nor amuse our hearers with the theories of science to the neglect of the truths of salvation; nor are we to be denounced as behind our age, if we sound an alarm against the would-be philosophical transcen- dentalism which is threatening by its mysticisms to envelop and obscure the truth as it is in Jesus. May the Spirit of God preserve us from a ministerial apostacy which without avowedly abandoning the common salvation would veil it in the drapery of human eloquence, or overlay its saving doctrines with the superincum- bency of science falsely so called. Nor, as congregationalists, do we need a new organization. Many of our churches within the last few years have been more or less assailed by brethren, who have denounced what they designate our one man system, as opposed to the unity of the church. They grievously lament that there are so many sections in the Christian church, and modestly propose to remedy the evil by adding another! Now we have diligently in- quired touching all the boasted advan- tages of their new organization, and the result is, that of their most vaunted excellencies, there is not one, if reaUy good, but may be enjoyed by congrega- tionalists. The sincere piety of many who have been seduced from our com- munion, we do not question; but it is for a lamentation, that under pretence of exalted spirituality and pre-eminent charity, Christians of this new way have become the most sectarian and exclusive of all denominations. We, therefore, humbly submit that we hold fast that we have received, after the manner of the saints which were at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons. And that not merely on account of the scripturalness of our order, but because the spirituality we need is so apart from all externalism, as to be no more essentially dependent on our church polity than on our church architecture. Both alike being considerations im- measurably beneath the higher matter of the life and power of godliness in the heart. Yet though we want neither a new bible, a new ministry, nor a new organ- ization, there are wants of which it may be well for us to be reminded at this season. I. We want more of the unction of the Holy Spirit. We have evidence enough of the truth of revelation; for, as Pascal says, There is light enough for those who sincerely wish to see, though there is obscurity enough to confound those who wish to oppose. We, therefore, have light enough; but we need more warmth. That is, as individual Chris- tians we want, with the new year, such a new and large vouchsafement of divine influence as shall infuse new life into our private and public devotions. For what is prayer without unction 1 a solemn mockery. Continuing through the year this round of formal-\n\nPage 9\nTHE WANTS OF HE CHURCH FOR THE NEW YEAR. 9 ity we m.,v ^ left to 0„ idols, and falling away »<•_„„ our profession be a bye-word and a ma.* for the scorner; or, retaining our profession, be as life- less and as useless as an Egyptian mammy, too many of which may already be seen in the museum of the church. For as one has said, God looks not at the oratory of your prayers, how eloquent they are; nor at their geometry, how long they are; nor at their arithmetic, how many they are; nor at their logic, how methodical they are; but he looks at their sincerity, how spiritual they are. We need not amplify to Bhow how much we need a new unction with re- gard to all the other and varied exer- cises of piety, because if we get holy oil to the wheels of our prayers, then our reading, hearing, giving, and holy living, will all be so sublimated that we shall exclaim, Or ever I was aware my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. Failing this, the end of the year will not leave us where it found us. Our coldness will be increas- ing with every month, and as Foster somewhere expresses it, We shall be receding, degree after degree, from the warm and hopeful zone; till at last we shall enter the arctic circle, and become fixed in relentless and eternal ice. May it not also be affirmed, that members of churches want more spiri- tual mutual intercourse 1 And if the suggestion at the com- mencement of a new year should awaken attention to this desideratum, and lead to any practical measures for -its observance, it is believed the result would be beneficial. It surely must be acknowledged thatweare belowthestan- dard of scriptural requirement in this matter. When we read, How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! and are directed to behold it, it is not merely that we may gaze upon it with admiration, VOL. XIII.—FOURTH SEJUE9. but that we may be charmed to imi- tation. Again, when we read, They that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and turn to the apostolic in- junction, Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, we feel that our ordinary meet- ings in the house of God, or at the table of the Lord, do not realize the close and spiritual intercourse indicated in these and kindred passages of holy writ. It is quite true that the ener- gies required in all the pursuits of pro- fessional and industrial life, in the present age, may render it difficult to multiply religious meetings. But could not a Christian church be classed out into convenient numbers and localities, and meet once a month, as Christians and fellow members? each one contributing a psalm or hymn, a portion of scrip- ture, or some remark or inquiry of an experimental kind, which would elicit observations and friendly conversation; that would awaken mutual sympathy, and provoke one another to love and good works. It cannot be denied that in many large churches, if not in smaller ones, there is a want of reci- procity and almost of recognition among those who have professedly united themselves in a bond of holy fraternity, which should be the type of a world where  all the air is love. Now, just to the extent to which this defection exists, church fellowship must be con- fessed to be a shadow, a fiction, a delu- sion. Nor can it be said to realize the inspired illustration of its oneness, or its sympathy— For the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body. Therefore, The mem- bers should have the same care one for another, and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it, 1 Cor. xii. If, therefore, these remarks are just, c\n\nPage 10\n10 THE POWER OP THANKiGIVINa and mere spiritual fellowship is admitted to be among the wants of the church, let us seek to supply it, by the appoint- ment of such meetings of the members, as, under the divine blessing, may pro- mote so desirablean object. And the end of the year will justify the chang- ing of our tone frorruthatof reluctant complaint to grateful acknowledgment. The other want to which wo may briefly advert, is, a universal recognition of the importance of individual effort. It really would be of no small service for many old members of our churches to learn again their nursery rhymes, which sang of the little busy bee— to remind them^that a church of Christ should be like the active hive, in which no drones are permitted to nestle. The anatomy of the human body shows that every member and every organ has gome important function to perform, and that a paralysis of any one of these will derange^and impede the healthful operation of the whole. In an active church the drones must be without excuse, and our pastors should be care- ful, by promoting sabbath, and day, and ragged schools, bible classes, tract dis- tribution, village preaching, juvenile missionary associations, Chr ian m struction an. sick societip , <fec, &c, to furnish work fo. „ji v_earts and hands. We live in an earnest age, and the church must not be behind the world. But it will be so, if its members con- tent themselves with saying or thinking the church must be in earnest, instead of saying,  I must be in earnest, for I am a part of the church. It is, doubt- less, one of Satans devices to turn our mental eyes away from our individual selves, and fix them upon the church; that so, both with regard to our sins and our duties, we may lose ourselves in the crowd.

Bury St. Edmunds. THE POWER OP THANKSGIVING. BY ME. JOHN FREEMAN. The power of prayer, as a means of grace, is readily acknowledged by every true Christian. But as the precept, pray without ceasing, is immediately followed by the injunction, in every- thing give thanks, a few words on the power of thanksgiving may not be amiss at the beginning of a year which, for aught we know, may be no less eventful than that just closed. Noah, Daniel, and Job, were men of prayer; and, had they lived on the earth at the same period, their presence in a land would have done much to avert divine judgments from thousands around them. In short, it would have been an extreme case in which they would not have been a blessing to their nation; and, in that extreme case, their blessing would have returned into their own bosom. Thus in Ezek. xiv. 14, God says, Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in that I land, they should deliver but their own\n\nPage 11\nTRANSFERRED WORDS IN THE ENGLISH TESTAMENT. 11 souls by their righteousness. Yet it appears that the thanksgivings of these men were no less powerful than their prayers. Thus, numerous and fervent as Noahs prayers were, no one of them brought down from heaven a promise of seed-time and harvest till time itself shall cease. But when Noah virtually said, What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? and, in a grateful spirit, multiplied such authorized burnt-offer- ings as typified Christs giving himself a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling sa- vour, we behold an unprecedented result. For in Gen. viii. 20,21, it is said, Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake. A thinking man may learn from every circumstance; and a fact lately report- ed to the writer may set us thinking about the cause of some apparent mysteries in Gods providence. A gen- tleman some time ago, when passing through one of the wards in St. Lukes, had his attention directed to one of the inmates of that lunatic asylum, who startled him with this question :— Sir, did you ever bless God for your rea- son 1 The visitor, astounded at the question, said, No, I never did. Nor did I, said the afflicted inmate,  and God took it from me. Let us then believe that thanksgiving will preserve some mercies and add others. Thus let us bless God for all our mercies, and especially cherish habitual thankfulness for our recent preservation, when the arrows of death flew thick in every direction. Yea, as repentance has an essential connexion with fruits meet for repentance, so let our thankfulness to God be acted out in suitable works of faith and labours of love. In some cases, too, thanksgiving may be more powerful than prayer. Thus in Luke xvii. 13, we have recorded such a prayer of ten lepers as issued in a temporal salvation, while one out of the ten, adding thanksgiving, is addressed by the Saviour as an heir of eternal sal- vation. For though the Saviours words in Luke xvii. 19, are rendered, Thy faith hath made thee whole, the very same words in Luke vii. 60, are tran- slated, Thy faith hath saved thee. In fact, if cleansing from the leprosy had been all the Saviour intended when addressing him who added thanksgiving to prayer, the meaning would have been, Thy faith hath made thee as the other nine. But the language of Jesus was,Were therenot tenoleansed, but where are the nine 1 There are none found that returned to give glory to God except this alien. And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath saved thee. In thanksgiving, therefore, we act wisely for the future, and bring down upon the earth the days of heaven, where the redeemed cast their crowns before the throne, blessing Him whose mercy endureth for ever, and singing, Worthy the Lamb.

In the common English version, it is in seven instances rendered servant, in twenty minister, and in the remaining three it is merely Anglicised in form and\n\nPage 12\n12 TRANSFERRED WORDS IN THE ENGLISH TESTAMENT. written deacon. It is used in reference to the persons who drew the water which our Lord turned into wine; in reference to a civil magistrate, when it is said, he is the minister of God to thee for good; in reference to our Lord himself, when he is called a minister of the circumcision; in reference to Paul, ApolloBjTychicus, Timothy, Phoebe, and others, who were engaged in the service of Christ and his churches. All these are, for some cause or other, de- scribed as  deacons. The cognate word diakonia is in like manner rendered, in different passages of the English Testament, by the words, service, serving, ministry, ministration, ministering, administration, relief, office. The verb diakoneo is rendered serve, minister unto, administer, and in two instances (1 Tim. iii. 10 and 15) use the office of a deacon; where, if the version had been as literal as in many other passages, it would have been, then let them serve, being found blameless, they that have served well purchase to themselves a good degree. Whatever ecclesiastical associations may be connected with the meaning of the word diakonos, in the minds of modern readers it is evident that its use was not confined originally to church officers, or religious persons. The epi- thet was applied by the Greeks to those who waited on them at table. The deacons of Satan are mentioned by Paul in contrast with the deacons of righteousness. In the parable of the wedding garment, the king is repre- sented as commanding his deacons to bind the offending guest, and carry him nway. Peters wifes mother arose after her cure, and used the office of a deacon to our Lord, and to those who were with him; and Martha complained of Mary that she had left her to use the office of a deacon alone. A deacon, in truth, is one who serves. Dr. George Campbell distinguishes between a diakonos and a doclos> thus :— In the proper and primitive sense of Jiokovoc (diakonos), it is a servant who attends his master, waits on him at table, and is always near his person to obey his orders, which was accounted a more creditable kind of service. By the word JouXoc (doulos), is not only meant a servant in general (whatever kind of work he be employed in), but also a slave. It is solely from the scope and connexion that we must judge, when it should be rendered in the one way, and when in the other. In the passage before us —[Matthew xx. 26, 27, which this eminent critic renders, Whosoever would become great amongst you, let him be your servant; and whosoever would be chief amongst you, let him be your slave,]— the view in both verses is to signify that the true dignity of the Christian will arise more from the service he does to others, than the power he possesses over them. We are to judge, therefore, of the value of the words from the im- port of those they are contrasted with. And as desiring to be great is a more moderate ambition than desiring to be chief, we naturally conclude, that aa the word opposed to the former should be expressive of some of the inferior stations in life, that opposed to the latter must be expressive of the lowest. When this sufficiently suits the ordinary signification of the words, there can hardly remain any doubt. As this is manifestly the case here, I did not know any words in our language by which I could better express a difference of de- gree, so clearly intended, than the words servant and slave. The word minister is now appropriated to the servants, not of private masters, but of the public. It is from the distinctions in private life, well known at the time, that our Lords illustrations are bor- rowed. The following is a list of the instances\n\nPage 13\nPOPERY, AS IT IS IN LONDON. 13 in which the word diakonos occurs in the Greek Testament:— Mitt xx. 26 Let him be your minuter. xxii. 13. ...Then sai.I the king to the servants. xxiii. 11 ....Greatest among yon shall be your servant.

POPERY, AS IT IS IN LONDON. It has long been the policy of Romish teachers to present their dogmas and practices to the inhabitants of this country in so mild and attenuated a form as to cause them to appear but little different from opinions and modes of worship with which the auditors were familiar. This has been so far successful that to multitudes of our intelligent countrymen it seems uncan- did to describe the services performed as idolatrous, or to maintain that popery as it now exists is ruinous to the souls of men. Dr. Wiseman represents it as the universally received doctrine of his church that it is sinful to pay the same homage or worship to the saints, or to the greatest of the saints, or the highest of the angels in heaven, which wc pay to God: that supreme honour and worship are reserved exclusively to him, that from him alone can any blessing possibly come, that he is the sole fountain of salvation and grace, and all spiritual or even earthly gifts,— and that no one created being can have any power, energy, or influence, of its own, in carrying into effect our wishes or desires. Such is the language of the controvertist; but how awfully are the authorized services of his church adapted to draw away the heart from the fountain of all goodness, and fix the hope, the confidence, the attachment, on frail creatures, who themselves needed a Saviour, and who possessed no real excellence but that which they derived from Emmanuels fulness. It may be useful then to give a specimen of idolatrous worship as now practised openly by adherents of the church of Rome in the metropolis of England.\n\nPage 14\nu THINK OF JERUSALEM. It is not a disputable specimen; it is a part of the Devotions of the Fathers of the Oratory, sung by them in an assembly to which hundreds habitually repair, printed for their use, purchased at their booksellers, bearing date, 1849. u TUB PATRONAGE OF ST. JOSEPH. Dear husband of Mary ] dear Nurse of her Child 1 Lifes ways are full weary, the desert is wild; Bleak sands are all round us, no home can we Beo! Sweet Spouse of our Lady! we lean upon thee. For thou to the pilgrim art Father and Guide, And Jesus and Mary felt safe by thy side; Ah! blessed Saint Joseph! how safe should I be, Sweet Spouse of our Lady! If thou wert with mo! O blessed Saint Joseph ! how groat was thy worth, The one chosen shadow of God upon earth, The Father of Jesus—ah! then wilt thou be, Sweet Spouso of our Lady! a father to me? Thou hast not forgotten the long dreary road, When Mary took turns with thee, bearing thy God; Yet light was that burden, none lighter could be; Sweet Spouse of our Lady! O canst thou bear me? A cold, thankless heart, and a mean lore of ease, What weights, blessed Patron! more galling than these? My life, my past life, thy clear vision may see; Sweet Spouse of our Lady I 0 canst thou love me T 0 give me thy burden to bear for awhile; Lot me kiss His warm lips, and adore His sweet smile; With her Babe in her arms, surely Mary will be. Sweet Spouse of our Lady I my pleader with thee. When the treasures of God were unsheltered on earth; Safe keeping was found for thorn both in thy worth; O Father of Jesus! be father to me. Sweet Spouse of our Lady! and I will love thee. God chose thee for Jesus and Mary—wilt thou Forgive a poor exile for choosing thee now? There is no Saint in Heaven I worship like thee. Sweet Spouse of our Lady 1 O deign to love me! THINK OF JERUSALEM. Remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.—Jer. li. 50. Sons of a race beloved of God, a race of high renown, Alas! that trampled in the dust lies your ancestral crown! Alas! that Judahs pride is dim, and Israels triumphs oer, The palace of their kings oerthrown, their holy house no more! Ye, who have loved your native hills and pleasant homes so well, Must now away, in stranger lands, the victors train to swell; In Babels busy marts to toil, or languish in her keep, Or where her streams are rolling free, your freedoms want to weep. Yet sorrow not with selfish grief,—Jerusalem is waste! Her sculptured pride is cast aside, by ruthless hands defaced; The lambent flames have scorched her walls, the mounts have laid them low; Let Salems children think of her,—deep is the parents woe! She sits in solitude, who ruled, a noble queen, but now; The royal robe about her form, the diadem on her brow; Her banner waving in the breeze, with warrior hosts untold; But death or bonds have vanquished these, and none dares that unfold. Think of her sunny vales, between whose banks the Kedron sweeps; Think of the mount upon whose brow the closing daybearn sleeps; Think of her well-trimmed hills of vine, and fields of ripening grain, Her crowded shrine, and rites divine, and pomp of queenly train.\n\nPage 15\nTHINK OP JERUSALEM. 18 Think of her, in your midnight dreams—her image be your rest! Think of her, in your noonday toils—twill soothe the stricken breast; Think of her, when on bended knee, Gods pitying eye you claim; Still worship towards the holy place, where once lie set his name. And think of Him, the Good, the True, who Egypts power defied, Redeemed your fathers from the yoke, when unto him they cried: Perchance hell turn again, and smile on Zions dreary doom, And bid the woe-worn captives back to raise her from the tomb. To build again those hallowed walls, and worship there in truth, Amidst the memory-tears of age, and joyous shouts of youth ;* To gaze upon  the goodly land, and win its fruitful spoils; And wake the strain they wooed in vain, from bondage and its toils. And have not we a home beloved? far distant, yet how near! That asks our thoughts while journeying on,  pilgrims and strangers here: Jerusalem, thou land of light! thou city of our King! To thee well raise our ardent gaze, and strive thy songs to sing. Thou art in truth a home for souls, in troubled world like this; Thou hast the Centre of their rest, the Author of their bliss; Thou dost not know of tears of wpe, nor pain, nor death, have place; The grace of every joy is thine, and joy of every grace. Ks ours thine  outeT courts  to tend—the threshold not the fane; The entrance-gate, where good men wait, more meetness to attain. Are these in circumstance of need? In barrenness and gloom? God speed the hour, whose quickening power, shall make the desert bloom. With praise, that heavens own lofty truth our earthen vessels bear, Well mingle, for its onward course, the earnest voice of prayer. Zion, he best remembers thee, who with uplifted eye, Looks to that throne, where reigns alone, thine Advocate on high. Well think of thee,—the night is dark, and tempests are abroad; Faint hearted are thy chosen sons, they feebly wield the sword; Thy conquests are but few and far, thou art a  bruised reed,— The bush through ages wrapped in flames, yet unconsumed indeed! Well think of thee, in bonds beneath, and yield thee filial love; Well think of thee, redeemed from death, all free and fair above. And when we burst our captives bond, and wings immortal wear, We 11 soar the distant hills beyond, and pay our worship there. Streatham. J.

No theologian has arisen this century who has exercised a more important influence on his contemporaries than the late Dr. Chalmers, or whose cha- racter it is more desirahle that readers of all ranks and denominations should thoroughly understand. While he re- mained in connexion with the Scottish ecclesiastical establishment, there was no section of the Christian church whose chiefs did not honour him as an effective preacher, and an able teacher of the rising ministry; even then, the magnanimity of his purposes, the energy of his intellect, and the com- prehensiveness of his charity, rendered him an object of general esteem and confidence among presbytcrians and episcopalians, independents and bap- tists. The circumstances which de- volved on him the leading part in the heroic procedings of that memorable May in which four hundred and seventy- four ministers of the church of Scot- land resigned their offices and emolu- ments in compliance with the dictates of conscience, and the admirable manner in which he conducted himself amidst the difficulties of that crisis, invested him with additional interest; and now, his course having terminated, he can- not fail to be regarded as a specimen of human nature which intelligent men of every class will desire to study closely. It affords us pleasure to announce VOL. XIII.—FOVBTH SERIES. the publication of the last volume of that interesting posthumous series which has been two years in progress, and, at the same time, the first volume of a detailed Memoir of his Life and Writings, by the well-furnished mem- ber of his domestic circle to whom the work was delegated. The volume is peculiarly acceptable, as it includes the history of his early life. Comprising the first thirty-three years of his course, it exhibits the preparatory processes by which he was fitted for the services he was afterwards to perform, and dis- closes particulars respecting his mental history which could not with propriety be published while he remained among us, but without a knowledge of which we could have but inadequate views of the wisdom and goodness displayed to- wards him. Some glances at his mental history, as pourtrayed in this volume, will we doubt not be pleasing and pro- fitable to our readers. It was not till he was nearly thirty years of age that Mr. Chalmers under- went that great change which is de- scribed in the apostolic writings as passing from death unto life. This is sometimes effected so gradually, and preceded by so much apparent con- formity to spiritual habits, that it is not easily perceptible to bystanders; but in the case of Mr. Chalmers, it was his becoming obviously, to all his acquaintance, a new creature. He had been from his youth open-hearted, benevolent, discerning, and energetic; he had been trained to observe the forms of religion, and he had taken upon himself the responsibilities of a parish minister. His pastoral duties were discharged with professional regu- larity; mathematics and chemistry were\n\nPage 18\n18 EARLY LIFE OF DR. CHALMERS. his favourite pursuits, but literary celebrity was the object of his most ardent desire. This portion of his life is, however, instructive. ITis aspiring temperament and inadequate success show us a man of superior powers and attainments restless and uneasy, dis- satisfied with the present and without definite aim in regard to the future. Anxiously seeking for opportunities to distinguish himself, he found one in accordance with his official predilec- tions, when in the General Assembly of 1809 he delivered a brilliant speech, advocating such advancement in the temporal circumstances of the clergy as might increase their importance, and give splendour and efficacy to their exertions. But, soon after this, it pleased his heavenly Father tocom- mence a course of operations on his heart, by which he was drawn towards a Redeemer whom he had served nominally, but whose love he had never known. A pious uncle died suddenly, leaving him one of his trustees, and this was the commencement of a series of events which will be described best in the words of Dr. Hanna:— The state of his health did not admit of Mr. Chalmers leaving Kilmany till the begin- ning of August. He returned to Anstrutherat the close of September, and it was some exposure in coming home from that second visit, which threw him into that long, severe, and most momentous illness, during which the first stage of a great and entire spiritual revolution was accomplished in him. For four months he never left his room; for upwards of half a year he never entered his pulpit; it was more than a twelvemonth before all the duties of his parish were again regularly dischargcil by him. His illness, which was an affection of the liver, was such as to require the application of the very strongest medicines. 1 visited him, says Professor Duncan, at Fincraigs, where he was under the medical treatment of Dr. Bam- say of Dundee, and I certainly never saw any person so much altered in the same space of time, being then greatly attenuated, while formerly he was corpulent. lie was scarcely able to walk across the .room. It was a year or two before he recovered, and during that period he bad much the appearance of an old man, of one who would never be able again for much exertion. But although the body was thus weakened and reduced, the mind was left in untouched vigour; and into it, now left to its own profound and solitary] musings, there sunk the deepest and most overpowering im- pression of human mortality. For upwards of twenty years death had never entered his family circle. Perhaps the first time that he had ever stood face to face in presence of the last enemy, and seen the last stroke given, was when he witnessed the death of his brother George. But death was now to be no stranger: already had he borne away two of the family in his cold embrace; and two of his sisters were at this time threat- ened with the same fatal malady. Mr. Ballar- die had passed into eternity in a moment. It seemed as if, once begun, the quick succession was to go on unbroken. A panic seized the family, as if one after another they were doomed to fall. Partaking fully of that panic, Mr. Chalmers believed that be was about to die. For days and weeks he gazed upon the death brought thus so near, with eye intent aud solemnized. My confinement, wrote Mr. Chalmers, has fixed on my heart a very strong impression of the insignificance of time —an impression which I trust will not aban- don me, though I again reach the heyday or health and vigour. This should be the first step to another impression still more salutary— the magnitude of eternity. Strip human life of its connexion with a higher scene of exist- ence, and it is the illusion of an instant, an unmeaning farce, a scries of visions and pro- jects, and convulsive efforts, which terminate in nothing. I have been reading Pascals Thoughts on Religion: you know his history— a man of the richest endowments, and whose youth was signalized by his profound and original speculations in mathematical science, but who could stop short in the brilliant career of discovery, who could resign all the splen- dours of literary reputation, who could re- nounce without a sigh all the distinctions which are conferred upon genius, and resolve to devote every talent and every hour to the defence and illustration of the gospel. This, my dear sir, is superior to all Greek and to all Boman fame. pp. 151, 152. Contemplated from the confines of eternity, his past life looked to Mr. Chalmers like a feverish dream, the fruitless chasing of a shadow. Blinded by the fascination of the things seen and temporal, he had neglected the things unseen and eternal. He had left undis- charged the highest duties of human life, and he had despised that faith which can alone lend\n\nPage 19\nEARLY LIFE OF DR. CHALMERS. 19 enduring value to its labours, and shed the light of a satisfying hope around its close. Ilow empty had all these bygone years been of God! True, he had not been wholly forget- ful; many an adoring thought of the Almighty, as the great Creator, Upholder, Governor of the universe, had filled bis mind, and many grateful feelings towards his heavenly Bene- factor had visited his heart. But that, he now felt, was not enough. The clear unchallenge- able right belonged to God over the full affec- tion of the heart, the unremitting obedience of the life; but no such affection had been enter- tained; and it had been but seldom that a distinct regard to the will of God had given its birth or its direction to any movement of his past history. In name acknowledged, but in their true nature and extent misunderstood, he felt that his Creators claims over him had been practically disallowed and dishonoured during his whole career. The meagre and superficial faith of former years could no longer satisfy him. It could not stand the scrutiny of the sick-room ; it could not bear to be confronted with death; it gave way under the application of its own chosen test; for surely, even reason taught that if man have a God to love and i KTve, and an eternity beyond death to provide for, towards that God a supreme and abiding sense of obligation should be cherished, and to the providing for that eternity the whole efforts of a lifetime should be consecrated. Con- vinced of the fatal error npon which the whole scheme of his former life had been constructed, Mr. Chalmers resolved upon a change. He would no longer live here as if here he were to live for ever. Henceforth and habitually he would recognize his immortality: and remem- bering that this fleeting pilgrimage was a scene of trial, a place of spiritual probation, he would dedicate himself to the service of God, and live with the high aim and purpose of one who was in training for eternity. It was a kind of life which bad already been realized by countless thousands of his fellow men, and why not by him? It had been realized by Pascal in mak- ing the sublime transition from the highest walks of science to the still higher walk of faith. It had been realized by those early Christians whose lives and testimonies he was now engaged in studying. Surrounded with fuch a cloud of witnesses, a new ambition, stronger and more absorbing than that which had thirsted so eagerly for literary fame, fired Mr. Chalmers breast. Every thought of his heart, every word of his lip, every action of his life, he would henceforth strive to regulate under a high presiding sense of his responsibili- ty to God; his whole life he would turn into a preparation for eternity. With all the ardour of a nature which never could do anything by halves, with all the fervour of an enthusiasm which had at length found an object worthy of its whole energies at their highest pitch of effort, he gave himself to the great work of setting himself right with God. The com- mencement of such an enterprise marks a great and signal epoch in his spiritual history. It sprung out of hisj profound sense of human mortality; his vivid realizing of the life that now is in its connexion with the life that is to come; his recognition of the supremacy which God and the high interests of eternity should wield over the heart and life of man. It did not originate in any change in his speculative belief, induced by his studies cither of the con- tents or credentials of the bible. In the course of that memorable transition-period which elapsed from the beginning of November, 1809, till the close of December, 1810, important modifications in his doctrinal views wero undoubtedly effected. His partial discovery of the pervading and defiling element of ungodli- ness, gave him other notions of human depra- vity than those he had previously entertained, and prepared him not only to acquiesce in, but to appropriate to himself representations from which a year before he would have turned away with disgust. And with his altered view of human sinfulness, there came also an altered view of the atonement. He was prepared now to go farther than he had gone before in recog- nizing the death of Christ as a true and proper sacrifice for sin. Still, however, while looking to that death for the removal of post guilt, he believed that it lay wholly with himself after he had been forgiven, to approve himself to God, to win the Divine favour, to work out the title to the heavenly inheritance. The full and precise effect of Christs obedience unto death was not as yet discerned. Over that central doctrine of Christianity which tells of the sinners free justification before God through the merits of his Son, there hung an obscuring mist; there was a flaw in the motive which prompted the struggle in which Mr. Chalmers so devotedly engaged; there was a misconcep- tion of the object which it was possible by such a struggle to reolize. More than a year of fruitless toil had to be described, ere the true ground of a sinners acceptance with God was reached,and the true principleof all acceptable oIh;- dience was implanted in his heart. pp. 153-155. Some years afterwards, reviewing this part of his life, Dr. Chalmers ex- pressed himself thus, in a letter to a friend :— * I stated to you that the effect of a very\n\nPage 20\n20 EARLY LIFE OP DR. CHALMERS. long confinement, about ten years ago, npon myself, was to inspire me with a set of very strenuous resolutions, under which I wrote a Journal, and made many a laborious effort to elevate my practice to the standard of the Divine requirements. During this course, however, I got little satisfaction, and felt no repose. I remember that somewhere about the year 1811,1 had Wilberforces View put into my hands, and, as I got on in reading it, felt myself on the eve of a great revolution in all my opinions about Christianity. I am now most thoroughly of opinion, and it is an opinion founded on experience, that on the system of—Do this and live, no peace, and even no true and worthy obedience, can ever be attained. It is, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. When this belief enters the heart, joy and confidence enter along with it. The righteousness which we try to work out for ourselves eludes our impo- tent grasp, and never can a soul arrive at true or permanent rest in the pursuit of this object. The righteousness which, by faith, we put on, secures our acceptance with God, and secures our interest in his promises, and gives us a part in those sanctifying influences by which we are enabled to do with aid from on high, what we never can do without it. Wc look to God in a new light — we see him as a reconciled Father; that love to him which terror scares away, re-enters the heart, and, with a new principle and a new power, we become new creatures in Jesus Christ our Lord. pp. 185, 186. External indications of the moment- ous change which had taken place within were speedily perceptible. His regular and earnest study of the bible was one of the first and most noticeable effects of Mr. Chalmers conversion. His nearest neighbour and most frequent visitor was old John Bonthron, who, having once seen better days, was admitted to an easy and privileged familiarity, in the exercise of which one day before the memorable illness, he said to Mr. Chalmers— I find you aye busy, sir, with one thing or another, but coino when I may, I never find you at your studies for the sabbath. Oh, an hour or two on the Saturday evening is quite enough for that, was the ministers answer. But now the change had come, and John, on entering the manse, often found Mr. Chalmers poring eagerly over the pages of the bible. The difference was too striking to escape notice, and with the freedom given him, which he was ready enough to use, he said, J never come in now, sir, but I find you aye at your bible, All too little, John, all too little, was the significant reply. p. 262. Of course the change affected his preaching, and his intercourse with his flock. Previously, his ministry had been unpopular, his church was poorly- attended, and his exertions were in- effective; but afterwards he set himself earnestly to his work, and could no longer be content with perfunctory The opening months of 1811, as they brought tranquillity and establishment to his own heart, so they gave a new character to his sabbath ministrations. It was not, however, till the close of that year that the complete re-establishment of bis health, and the fulfil- ment of his engagements with Dr. Brewster, enabled him to give full time and strength to his compositions for the pulpit. The result was a series of discourses, a goodly number of which, delivered almost verbally as originally written, were listened to in after years by con- gregated thousands in Glasgow, and Edinburgh, and London, with wondering and entranced admiration. I have been able to trace to this period so many of the sermons afterwards selected by their author for publication, and have found so few alterations made on the original manuscripts in preparing them for the press, as to be satisfied that the three final years of his ministry at Kilmany supplied as many, as elaborate, and as eloquent discourses, as any other three years in the whole course of his ministry. It was not the stimulus of cultivated audiences, and an intellectual sphere —it was not the effort to win or to sustain a wide-spread popularity—it was not the strain- ing after originality of thought or splendour of illustration, which gave to these discourses their peculiar form and character. They were, to a great extent, the spontaneous products of that new love and zeal which Divine grace had planted in his soul; the shape and texture of their eloquence springing from the combined operation of all his energies — intellectual, moral, and emotional—whose native movements were now stimulated into a more glowing intensity of action by that controlling motive which concentrated them all upon one single and sublime accompaniment—the salvation of immortal souls. pp. 417, 418. The discovery that pardon and full recon- ciliation with God are offered gratuitously to all men in Christ, had been the turning point\n\nPage 21\nEARLY LIFE OF DR. CHALMERS. il in Mr. Chalmers own spiritual history; and the most marked characteristic of his pulpit ministrations after his conversion was the fre- quency and fervour with which he held out to sinners Christ and his salvation as Gods free gift, which it was their privilege and their duty at once and most gratefully to accept. Most earnest entreaties that every sinner he spoke to should come to Christ just as he was, and 1 bury all his fears in the sufficiency of the great atonement, were reiterated on each succeeding sabbath, presented in all possible forms, and delivered in all different kinds of tones and of attitudes. He would desert for a minute or two his manuscript, that with greater direct- ness and familiarity of phrase, greater pointcd- ness and personality of application, he might urge upon their acceptance the gospel invita- tion. • He would bend over the pulpit, said one of his old hearers, and press us to take the gift, as if be held it that moment in his hand, and would not be satisfied till every one of us had got possession of it. And often when the sermon was over, and the psalm was sung, and he rose to pronounce the blessing, he would break out afresh with some new entreaty, unwilling to let us go until he bad made one more effort to persuade us to accept of it. pp.417—120. And what was the result of this, in regard to the hearers? It was not long till the whole aspect of the sabbath congregations in Kilmany church was changed. The stupid wonder which used to sit on the countenances of the few villagers or farm-servants who attended divine service, was turned into a fixed, intelligent, and devout attention. It was not easy for the dullest to remain uninformed; for, if the preacher some- times soared too high for the best trained of his people to follow him, at other times, and much oftener, he put the matter of his message so as to force for it an entrance into the most sluggish understanding. Nor was it easy for the most indifferent to remain unmoved, as the first fervours of a new-born faith and love found such thrilling strains in which to vent themselves. The church became crowded. The feeling grew with the numbers who shared in it. The fame of those wonderful discourses whichwere now emanating from the burning lips of thisnew evangelist spread throughout the neighbourhood, till at last there was not an adjacent parish which did not send its weekly contribution to his ministry. Tenons from extreme distances in the county found them- telvesrside by side in the same crowded pew. Looking over the congregation, the inhabitant of Dundee could generally count a dozen or two of his fellow townsmen around him, while ministers from Edinburgh or Glasgow were occasionally detected among the crowd. All this told distinctly enough of the popularity of the preacher; but within the parish, and as the effect of such a ministry as has been now described, what were the spiritual results ?—Too delicate a question this for any full or satisfactory reply; but of one sabbaths service we shall tell the fruits. It was in the spring of 1812, and the preachers text was John iii. 16,—* God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever belicvcth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Two young men heard this sermon, the one the son of a farmer in the parish, the other the son of one of the villagers. They met as the • congregation dispersed. Did you feel anything particularly in church to-day? Alexander Paterson said to his ac- quaintance, Robert Edie, as they found them- selves alone upon the road. I never, he continued, felt myself to be a lost sinner till to-day, when I was listening to that sermon. It is very strange, said his companion, it was just the same with me. They were near a plantation, into which they wandered, as the conversation proceeded. Hidden at last from all human sight, it was proposed that they should join in prayer. Screened by the opening foliage, they knelt on the freBh green sod, and poured out in turn their earnest petitions to the hearer and answerer of prayer. Both dated their conversion from that day. Alexander Paterson went shortly afterwards to reside in the neighbouring parish of Dairsie, but attended regularly on the sabbath at Kilmany church. His friend, Robert Edie, generally convoyed him part of the way home. About one hun- dred yards from the road along which they travelled, in the thickly-screened seclusion of a close plantation, and under the shade of a branching fir-tree, the two friends found a quiet retreat, where, each returning sabbath evening, the eye that seeth in secret looked down upon these two youthful disciples of the Saviour on their knees, and for an hour their ardent prayers alternately ascended to the throuc of grace. The practice was continued for years, till a private footpath of their own had been opened to the trysting-trce; and when, a few years ago, after long absence on the part of both, they met at Kilmany, at Mr. Edics suggestion they rc-visited the spot, and renewing the sacred exercise, offered up their joint thanks- givings to that God who had kept them by his grace, and in their separate spheres had honoured each of them with usefulness in the church. Mr. Paterson has now laboured for\n\nPage 22\n22 EARLY LIFE OF DR. CHALMERS. twenty-two years as a missionary in the Canon- gate of Edinburgh, not without many pleasing evidences that his labours have been blcflBcd; and I have reason to believe that by his efforts in behalf of bible and missionary societies, through means of sabbath schools and prayer- meetings, and by the light of a guiding and consistent example, Mr, Edies life, while one of active industry, had also been one of devoted Christian usefulness. pp. 427—430. The surrounding clergy, however, proclaimed that he was mad; and this was believed and reported, even after he had entered upon another scene of la- bour. A gentleman and his wife, one sabbath, going to church in Glasgow, met a friend who spoke to them, and inquired where they were going. They said, * To hear Dr. Chalmers. He said, * What 1 to hear that madman? They said, if he would agree to go with them, and hear Dr. Chalmers for once, and if after that he persisted in talking in such a mauner of him, they would never dispute the matter with him again. He accompanied them; and, singular to relate, it happened that, when Dr. Chalmers entered the pulpit that day, he gave out as his text,  I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness; and the gentleman, who I rather think was a medical man, became from that day a changed man,—a convert to evangelical Christianity. pp. 504, 505. A few sentences descriptive of the effects of his ministry in the two different periods into which it was divided, as given by himself in his Farewell Sermon at Kilmany, deserves to be read again and again, especially in a time of religious languor. And here I cannot but record the effect of an actual though undesigned experiment which I prosecuted for upwards of twelve years among you. For the greater part of that time I could expatiate on the meanness of dishonesty, on the villany of falsehood, on the despicable arts of calumny; in a word, upon all those deformities of character which awaken the natural indigna- tion of the human heart against the pests and the disturbers of human society. Now could I, upon the strength of these warm expostula- tions, have got the thief to give up his stealing, and the evil speaker his censoriousness, and the liar his deviations from truth, I should have felt all the repose of one who had gotten his ulti- mate object. It never occurred to me, that all this might have been done, and yet the soul of every hearer have remained in full alienation from God, and that even could I have esta- blished in the bosom of one who stole, such a principle of abhorrence at the meanness of dis- honesty that he was prevailed upon to steal no more, he might still have retained a heart as completely unturned to God, and as totally un- possessed by a principle of love to Him as before. In a word, though I might have made him a more upright and honourable man, I might have left him as destitute of the essence of religious principle as ever. But the inter- esting fact is, that [during the whole of that period in which I made no attempt against tbe natural enmity of the mind to God, while I was inattentive to the way in which this enmity is dissolved; even by the free offer on the one hand, and the believing acceptance on the other, of the gospel salvation j while Christ through whose blood the sinner, who by nature stands afar off, is brought near to the heavenly law- giver whom he has offended, was scarcely ever spoken of, or spoken of in such a way as strip- ped him of all the importance of his character and his offices, even at this time I certainly did press the reformations of honour, and truth, and integrity, among my people; but I never once heard of any such reformations having been effected amongst them. If there was anything at all brought about in this way, it was more than ever I got any account of. I am not sensible that all the vehemence with which I urged the virtues and the proprieties of social life, had the weight of a feather on the moral habits of my parishioners. And it was not till I got impressed by the utter alienation of the heart in all its desires and affections from God; it was not till reconciliation to him became the distinct and the prominent object of my minis- terial exertions; it was not till I took the scriptural way of laying the method of recon- ciliation before them; it was not till the free offer of forgiveness through the blood of Christ was urged upon their acceptance, and the Holy Spirit given through the channel of Christs mediatondrip to all who ask him was set before them as the unceasing object of their depend- ence and tbeir prayers; in one word, it was not till the contemplations of my people were turned to these great and essential elements in the business of a soul providing for its interest with God and the concerns of its eternity, that I ever heard of any of those subordinate reforma- tions which 1 aforetime made the earnest and the zealous, but I am afraid at the same time,\n\nPage 23\nBRIEF NOTICES. 23 the ultimate object of niy earlier ministrations. Ye servants.whose scrupulous fidelity has now at- tracted the notice, and drawn forth in my hear- ing a delightful testimony from your master?, what mischief you would have done, had your zeal for doctrines and sacraments been accom- panied by the sloth and the remissness, and what, in the prevailing tone of moral relaxa- tion, is counted the allowable purloining of your earlier days! But a sense of your heavenly masters eye has brought another influence to bear upon you; and while you arc thus striving to adorn the doctrine of God your Saviour in all things, you may, poor as you are, reclaim the great ones of the land to the acknowledg- ment of the faith. You have at least taught me that to preach Christ is the only effective way of preaching morality in all its branches: and out of your humble cottages have I gathered a lesson, which I pray God I may be enabled to carry with all its simplicity into a wider theatre, and to bring with all the power of its subduing efficacy upon the vices of a more crowded population, pp. 430—432. We hope to have other opportunities of directing attention to the career of this honoured servant of the Redeemer, as subsequent portions of the memoir appear. Of the successive volumes of his Posthumous Works we have spoken repeatedly, and were we now to add anything it would be to renew our cor- dial recommendation of that which seems likely to be the most permanently useful of all his publications—the Insti- tutes of Theology. Our attachment to works of this class is not strong, and our expectations from these two volumes were not sanguine; but wo have found in them such an avoidance of the evils with which systematic theology is generally combined, so much humility connected with spiritual discernment, and such warm effusions from a heart steeped in New Testament influences, that we should be sorry to neglect a fair opportunity of mentioning them to any fellow Christians who value our opinion.

These three books bound together so as to make a handsome and yet portable volume, as now kept for sale by Mr. Haddon, have, to our personal knowledge, caused young eyes to glisten.

There arc several prelimi- nary dissertations, which though brief, will be found instructive; and foot-notes are appended throughout, intended to remove the principal difficulties of the text—to clear up those obscu- rities which occur to minds not familiar with biblical criticism and theology—to reconcile apparent contradictions—to ascertain the signi- fication of parables, figures, and symbols—and to point out the aptitude of the allusions to the customs, manners, costume, and general pur- suits of those to whom the scriptures were first addressed, also to the history, productions, climates, and natural features of the countries which they inhabited. 3NV The Booh of the Prophet Joel London: Samuel Bagstcr and Sons. 8vo., pp. 20, The prophecy of Joel being throughout poetical and well adapted to show the advan- tages of a poetical arrangement of the prophets, has been selected far this purpose, ana printed in parallelisms.

The Eclectic Review. December, 1849. Lon- don: Ward and Co. With sorrow we contemplate these sheets as the last of the series to which they belong. It seem* but a little while since we were eager to receive the first number that was to appear under the superintendence of the beloved friend who had undertaken the editorship; thirteen years have elapsed, it appears, and now the state of his constitution requires that he should step into retirement and give place to a suc- cessor. May his remaining days be spent in the peaceful enjoyment of those principles which he has laboured to promulgate! What may be the abilities or the achievements of the man that is to come after him wc know not, and at present his name must not be mention- ed; but of this we are persuaded, that the readers of the Eclectic will never have to con- gratulate themselves upon an editor of more benevolence, integrity, and directness of pur- pose, than Thomas Price, He anticipates for it, however, a continuance in the same course as he has pursued.

Bosworth, M.A., whose ser- vices as Classical Tutor in the College at Montreal have often been mentioned, being on a visit to this country, we have requested him to furnish us with a birds-eye view of the state of religion in Canada, and he has favoured us with the following paragraphs:— Many cauBes concur in rendering the posi- tion of Canada, in a religious point of view, somewhat an anomalous one. The difficul- ties to be surmounted in the dissemination of the truth are either peculiar to the province, or more formidable than in any other coun- try, perhaps, where the English language is spoken. To the pressure of these difficulties is it owing that the state of religion there must be pronounced to be anything but encourag- ing. A reference to some of the most power- ful of these hindrances will, doubtless, serve best to exhibit the present posture of affairs in Canada. Within the province ignorance and fanati- cism abound to a most alarming extent. In no country in the world, perhaps, where the facilities lor acquiring information areasgreat, is there bo slight an acquaintance with the standard literature of the age and bo great a distaste for mental effort. The country is deluged with the cheap, trashy publications which daily issue from the presses of the United States. Every weeks express brings large quantities of novels to the exclusion, almost, of any works of lasting interest and value. They are to be found in the hotels and on the steamers in all parts of the pro- vince, silently yet surely producing their per- nicious effects, unrestrained by any taste for higher literature, or by that safeguard against the morbid excitement of the imagination which a thorough course of mental training supplies. Indeed, so great is the demand for these publications that the booksellers hesitate not to regard this branch of their business as necessary to their success. Nor is this all. The schools throughout the country, with some pleasing exceptions, are wretchedly inefficient. In many sections the choice of a schoolmaster does not depend on the possession of sufficient information for the discharge of his responsible duties and on an aptitude to teach, but on the sn a.lness of the sum for which his labours can be ensured. Teaching thus becomes too often the dernier resort of the indolent and the worthless. With mental powers undeveloped, and habits of indolence in the exercise of the thoughts induced, it cannot be surprising that even professors of religion must not, at least in the country parts, be exempted from the charge of ignorance. The Canadians are not a reading people, nor are Canadian Christians in general deep and prayerful students of the bible. Their religion is one rather of feeling than of intelligent assent; hence their attain- ments are superficial, not profound. Need it be wondered at then that the wildest notions to which an unrestrained and excited imagination can give rise, find in Canada a congenial soil? The vast extent of frontier (and, in new countries at least, such districts are pre-eminently the abodes of ignorance and fanaticism) renders the intro- duction and transmission of the crudest dogmas and the most licentious doctrines peculiarly easy. Thus in some parts of the eastern townships the  Millerite delusion reached its height some few years since in acts of extravagance almost surpassing belief. In almost every corner of the province univers- alists are found insidiously and zealously propagating their fearful doctrines, and fre- quently, with honesty at least, practically exhibiting their belief in the salvation of the vilest, irrespective of faith in Christ. One of their preachers once affirmed to a missionary, that were the parricide to terminate at once his career and his crimes by taking his own life he would immediately be received up into glory. Then there are the Campbell- ites, CAmrians, Mormons, and sceptics of every shade, from the deist to the infidel, un- settling the minds of men too little fortified, alas, by solid information of any kind. This craving after excitement rather than instruction manifests itself in the fondness which is frequently exhibited for religious services of a more exciting nature than those of a stated ministry, and for a style of preach- ing abounding in anecdotes and in harrowing appeals to the feelings, in a word, for sound rather than sense. The sad want of liberality in the mainten- ance of stated worship is another hindrance to the progress of the truth. The emigrant part of the population having left their native land to better their circumstances, too often slight the public services of religion, and with reluctance contribute to their maintenance. Whereas the natives and old settlers knowing well the scarcity of money in the province\n\nPage 27\nHOME INTELLIGENCE. 27 are careful to keep it. These remarks apply too often, alas! to the professors of religion. Besides this, it must be borne in mind that numbers of the founders of churches in the country were farmers, whose ministrations were entirely gratuitous—that very many such preachers are now zealously and disin- terestedly labouring in various parts—and that several religious bodies foster, not inten- tionally perhapB, this spirit of illiberally by fully sustaining their ministers or missionaries. In Canada generally preaching must be cheap in order to be enjoyed. Of course there are very many pleasing exceptions, but this is the prevailing sentiment. A few instances of the want of Christian liberality will not be improper. An excellent missionary with deep gratitude wrote home to his society informing them that his people had engaged to raise him j£70. Years have passed away since then, but thirty of the seventy only have been received. A laborious pastor once confessed that all the money he had received during the year Was £2. Another, as the pecuniary result of a years labour—during which six or seven sewices were held weekly —obtained a horse and forty dollars. As their pastor had been ill some of his church engaged to pay the doctors bill, and how? The grain with which payment Was to be made was so utterly worthless that respect alone for the minister prevented the medical man from throwing it into the road. The plan is to pay the pastor, not in money, but in pork, butter, apples, firewood, hay, &c. And frequently is it the case that the articles sent are not only very bad, but the prices exorbitant. Any conduct, nay, even trickery, seems to be allowable, by which the pastors clai ms can be m ost easily met. Under these circumstances the duty of the missionary becomes very trying, and want is often severely felt. If he does not complain his people will half starve him. If remon- strance be made offence is taken, for there is nothing respecting which mens minds, throughout the province, are more susceptible than that Which relates to the pocket. If full support be obtained elsewhere the evil is, and ever will be, unredressed. The only plausible plan is partially to support an in- defatigable ministry whose chief aim shall be to engage the affections of the young, and make thenl the objects of his prayerful solici- tude and untiring efforts. In the young is the hope of Canada. The third and the greatest hindrance to the progress of the truth in Canada, to which reference will now be made, arises from its mixed population. There are to be found the natives of various climes not as yet amalgamated. The names American, English, Scotch, and Irish, are not yet merged into that of Canadian. National antipathies and manners are very strong. A dispute arising from such a source led to the exclusion of all the British members from a church in the province. Another was rent asunder because while the American mem- bers insisted on females and mules sitting in separate parts of the house of worship, the old-country members indignantly opposed the measure. It is often the case where Scotch members predominate in n church, no minis- ter is regarded with much favour whose birth has not taken place north of the Tweed. Should, on the other hand, Americans out- number, a minister from the States must be procured. A still greater evil arising from such a mixed, disunited population is the great diversity of religious belief and practice, Few see alike, few act alike. Hence reli- gious bodies are very numerous and very small. In Montreal, for instance, there are upwards of twenty protestant places of worship to perhaps fifteen thousand protes- tants. Guelpb, with a population of two or three thousand, has nine separate churches. In Paris, whose inhabitants are scarcely more than fifteen hundred, there are five resident ministers and six churches, when two might amply discharge all the duties required. And what is worse still, not only are denominations numerous, but even these are subdivided. Thus in a town of three thousand persons there are three presby- terian ministers, two methodist, and two independent. Under these circumstances united efforts for the common cause are scarcely to be looked for. Petty quarrels and jealousies exhaust the energies required for far more important objects. And still further, in churches thus necessarily small, the varieties of belief, manners, &c, are so great, that but little unanimity is enjoyed, and if peace prevails the elements of disorder are at hand. Of course in the country, and especially in the back townships, this super- abundance of preaching is not enjoyed. On the contrary, a lamentable deficiency is felt. Many of these evils time will cure. National antipathies will soon subside, and with the increase of population, churches will become more harmonious and numerous. Yet it must not be concealed that the present is a period of momentous import to Canada. The youthful energies of a rising nation must now be directed. The characteristics of a great people will now be formed. To no higher or holier mission can the energies of the pious be turned. In no field of labour, perhaps, may success, with self-denial and hard labour indeed, be expected with greater probability. The yearnings of a Britons heart cannot, must not, but be felt towards the adopted country of Britains sons—a country which, with others, is destined to perpetuate the name of our fatherland, and to exert a powerful influence in the civilization and evangelizing of the world when we are no more.\n\nPage 28\n2rt HOME INTELLIGENCE. NOVA SCOTIA, &C. A deputation from the friends of religious and secular education in the lower provinces of British North America, viz., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, now in this country, have requested the in- sertion of the following statement. In the year 1828, a few persons, deeply deploring the lamentable destitution of their country, in regard to the means of mental culture, commenced, under many disadvan- tages, a seminary of learning, designed for the masses of the people, alike open to all, with- out reference to- sect or party. This institu- tion, situated in a new country, has had to contend with many obstacles, but, notwith- standing, it has gradually expanded into a college, of an enlarged and most useful character, designated, Acadia College, having for its object the preparation of young men to take charge of the primary schools of the country, the mental improvement in the higher branches of science of such as design to enter upon the learned professions, and theological training to candidates for the Christian ministry; all of which has been done to an extent highly creditable to the institution, and exceedingly beneficial to the people. In pursuit of these objects, the governors of the college have been sustained by voluntary contributions from the old as well as from the new world. In order to show the present financial position of the institution, it may be necessary to make the following statement of account, viz.: £ i. d. Cost of college and academy, buildings, land, <frc, from tbe commencement in 1828, to the present period, 21 years 5,000 0 0 Expenditure during that period for maintaining the institution 14,123 0 0 £19,123 0 0 The total receipts during that period, for liquidation of cost of buildings, aud to meet the annual expenditure, Including £800 collected by the Rev. John Pryor, in Great Britain, in 1844-J, have been 16,S04 0 0 Leaving a balance now owing by the institution of 2619 0 0 And which shows an average annual expenditure of C909, and income of £788. The deficiency of income here exhibited has gradually accumulated, and is easily explained, the main cause being the failure of the crops of the country for a number of years, impoverishing the ability, but by no means the interest, of its supporters. The governors and friends of the college have painfully witnessed this increase, and while since its commencement the most rigid economy has been observed, it is intended in future to practise still further that frugality of expenditure which it is hoped will place the same on a level with its income. To accomplish this, the collegiate department is now separated from the academical, and in future will be sustained for about £500 sterling per annum, to meet which there is a yearly income from subscriptions and other sources, of £450, leaving a small balance which will be made up by extra efforts. The academical department, it is expected, will in future be self-sustaining. It may be here stated that, independently of hundreds who have received the advantages of instruction at the collegiate academy, 89 students have graduated; 11 of whom are now successful preachers of the gospel, 11 others, of pious character, are designed for the same elevated calling, 30 are devoted to the im- portant business of instructing the youth of the country, and the remainder of the number are engaged in various professional and other vocations in life. During the present year, 28 students have attended the college classes, and about 75 the academical department. The population of the three provinces, viz, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and P. E. Island, is not far short of 500,000, at least one fifth of which number is deeply interested in the prosperity of this Institution. In fact, the civil and religious well-being of that large section of British North America, is identi- fied to a great extent with its success. To finish the college buildings, now in progress, and to render it efficient in all its departments, £1,500 are required; which, added to the amount of debt above stated, £2,619, makes £4,119 sterling. To raise this amount, efforts are being made in Great Britain, the United States, and the British Provinces in North America. The deputation to Great Britain is now here, for the purpose of making an appeal; in sup- port of which, in addition to what has already been stated, they may observe, that among many disadvantages to which the colonies are subjected, none have more materially retarded their improvement than their inadequate and defective means of education. Affected by this consideration, aged ministers of the gospel, themselves without the benefit of a scholastic education, but who, in the infancy of these colonies, had been the honoured instruments of spreading the gospel through the wilderness, about twenty years ago aroused their brethren to the duty of meeting the necessities of an advancing state of society, by placing the means of education within the reach of their youth. Hence arose the institution, whose claims are now presented to the friends in Great Britain. No country was ever in circumstances that more imperatively de- manded for its advancement the means of extended education, than the British North American Provinces, and the great object of those who have engaged in the cause has been, to offer the benefits of instruction to the body of the people throughout the\n\nPage 29\nHOME INTELLIGENCE. 20 country, in a manner calculated to secure their confidence and affection, and to meet their limited pecuniary means. Again, when we look at the asylum which the western world affords to thousands of wandering emigrants, who annually flock from Britain to its shores, and there find a home, the founders and supporters of the institution do conceive that the influence diffused therefrom will be deeply appreciated by all who love education, not only for its own sake, but who Talue it in its connection with the extension of civil and religious liberty, and appreciate it in its power to aid the church of God in her exertions, instrumentally for the salvation of the world. Letters of commendation from the Rev. E. A.Cbawley.D.D., Hon. J. W. Johnston, and other gentlemen of the provinces, addressed to different societies and individuals in the United Kingdom, are in possession of the deputation. ORDINATIONS. CHELSEA. It was announced a little more than twelve months ago that the editor of this Magazine was making an effort to revive the congrega- tion at Paradise Chapel, Queens Road, Chelsea, which had become very small and was gTeatly dispirited. During the year for which he undertook the pastorate a few were baptized, and others were received by letter from different churches, the number of hear- ers meanwhile gradually increasing. At the expiration of the period, the church, consist- ing then of fifty-eight members, unanimous- ly and earnestly requested him to take the office permanently. Two brethren who had recently been added, and had previously sustained the deacons office elsewhere, and two who had acted as assistants to the deacons formerly, consented to take the deaconship now in conjunction with one who had been for some time sole deacon; and this having been done harmoniously, Mr. Groser thought it his duty to accept office as pastor. On the 15th of December a special meeting was held to implore the divine bles- sing on these arrangements. Dr. Morison of Brompton had engaged to address the deacons on the occasion, and Dr. Cox of Hackney the church ; but the former being disabled by illness, the latter kindly per- formed both services, and Mr. Brown, Wesleyan minister of Chelsea, Mr. Soule of Battersea, and Mr. Lecchman of Hammer- smith, united in offering appropriate and fervent prayers. BURSLEH. The Rev. W. Barker late of Cradley, Worcestershire, has accepted the invitation of the baptist church, Burelem, and com- menced his stated labours among them on the 25th November, 1849. RECENT DEATHS. MRS. JOHN STOCK. The subject of the following brief notice was bom at Spalding in Lincolnshire, on the 15th April, 1822. From her childhood she was carefully instructed in the religion of Jesus, nor were her anxious parents left without early evidence that their labours for her souls benefit were effectual. While yet very young, she appears to have exhibited great tenderness of conscience, combined with a meek and quiet spirit. Indeed, so early and gradual was the work of grace upon her soul, that she could never re- fer to any particular period at which she was conscious of its commencement. This, in after years, often occasioned her considerable uneasiness. Yet, all who witnessed the loveliness of her character, the devoutness of her spirit, and the blamelessness of her life, were compelled to admire the grace of God in her. She enjoyed the benefit of a thorough and liberal education, which, in the position that she afterwards occupied as a ministers wife, she turned to the best account. The Crea- tor had endowed her with an attractive per- son; and this, combined with the sweetness of her disposition, and the accomplishments which she possessed, gained her many admirers j so that, before she had reached the age of nineteen, Bhe had received several offers of marriage, all of which, however, she declined. It was the privilege of the writer to win her young affections, and afterwards to call her his wife. And devoutly would he thank the Father of mercies for the benefit which he derived from his seven years asso- ciation with her in the matrimonial relation. Mis3 Harrisons union to the object of her choice was solemnized at the Independent chapel, Chelmsford, Oct. 12th, 1842. Her husband had at that time been recently or- dained pastor of the baptist church meeting in Zion chapel, Chatham. Among that peo- ple Mrs. Stock was permitted to labour for nearly six years, and gained their universal affection and confidence. The delicate state of her health, however, precluded her from engaging so fully as she desired in laborious efforts for the good of the cause; yet to the extent of her physical capabilities she was ever ready to serve the church of God. In May, 1848, Mr. Stock was removed by divine Providence to Salendine Nook, Hudderefield, and was accompanied to that important sphere of usefulness by his beloved companion. But, alas! the fearful malady the seeds of which had been sown in her delicate frame many years previously—there\n\nPage 30\n30 IIOME INTELLIGENCE. developed itself with affecting rapidity; so much so, that after living nmong her new friends sufficiently long to obtain a high place in their esteem, it was found necessary to remove her to the more genial air of the south. This placed her in n position pecu- liarly painful, inasmuch as she was unavoid- ably separated from her husband during a great portion of her last illness. Neverthe- less, she never murmured, but quietly sub- mitted to what was manifestly the will of God. Had there been the slightest hope of her recovery, her husband would have resigned his charge in the north, and sought a sphere of labour in a milder region; but as the highest medical authority asserted that it was utterly vain to indulge in any such hope, he felt it his duty to retain his existing pastoral connexion. However, through the kindness of his flock, he was permitted frequently to visit the dear sufferer, and to spend the last month of her sojourn on earth in her society. And gratefully would he adore the Divine goodness which permitted him thus to perform the part of a spiritual instructor to the wife of his youth, nmid her conflict with sickness and death. His mind, too, was relieved of much anxiety during his weeks of separation from his Buffering companion, inasmuch as he knew that Bhe was sheltered beneath the roof of her affectionate parents, whose attention to her comfort was tender and unremitting. At the commencement of her last illness, Mrs. Stock was deeply and painfully exer- cised in her mind. .She often mourned over the opportunities of doing good which she had neglected; and was but little comforted, when reminded that her delicate health had not permitted to her greater activity. She was overwhelmed with her perceptions of the divine purity, and once said,  I am about to appear before a Being of such infinite know- ledge, that I fear he will find in me sins which I have overlooked and failed to morti- fy ; and he hates sin with such an unutter- able intensity, that he cannot fail to reject the subject of one unmortilied transgression. This state of mental distress continued for several weeks; but prayer was made to God on her behalf without ceasing, by her pious relatives, and by the church at Salendine Nook; and graciously did the Lord hear and answer these petitions. Saturday, October 20th, was the most painful day which the invalid had yet passed, as to her physical sensations; but it was memorable as the period of her release from her spiritual darkness and depression. She felt that the blood of Jesus could and would cleanse her from her sins, and again rejoiced in hope of the glory of God. She ex- pressed a wish, at the close of this Saturday, that the next day (the sabbath) might be spent by her with Jesus. From this time her peace was never disturbed, but continued to flow as a river until her last sigh was heaved. Many were the solemn charges which she gave to her beloved relatives, and to the ser- vants in her fathers family, and precious were the encouragements which she address- ed to her weeping friends. So perfect was the tranquillity of her spirit, that she gave directions with regard to arrangements to be made subsequently to her death, without the least repugnance. The surrender which she made of herself, and of all her beloved rela- tives (not excepting her only living child), to the care of God, was unreserved and cheer- ful. Those beautiful hymns commencing— Rock of ages, cleft for me, &c, Jesus, lover of my soul, &c, To Jesus, the crown of my hope, &c, were often read to her, and fragments of them repeated by her. Among her dying sayings may be recorded the following:—I can now give up every- thing, that 1 may but be with Jesus. I am not afraid of eternity. I shall soon eat of the fruit of the heavenly Canaan. I know that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto him until that day. *• I long to be gone; and then bursting into tears, yet I hope I am not impatient. That text, My times are in thy hand, is very precious. All my hope centres in ray Saviour. On the morning of Monday, the 5th of November, a change took place in the sensa- tions of the patient, and in the aspect of her countenance, which plainly indicated that the mortal struggle was soon to terminate. The king of terrors stood brandishing his dart at the bedside of the sufferer, prepared to strike the fatal blow; yet the happy saint could look upon the fearful weapon without alarm, for on it she discovered the stains of Immanuels blood. From one until two oclock of this day, her dying pains were great. When they were at their height, she exclaimed, This is hard work; but immediately added, Yet it is nothing when compared with what my Sa- viour endured for me. At two oclock her agonies abated, and from that time she suffered but little. When speech had nearly failed, she fixed her piercing gaze upon the domestic who was in the room, and with difficulty exclaimed,  Sarah, but could not say more. Again she tried to speak, and with great difficulty uttered this weighty and comprehensive charge, Sarah, meet me in heaven! The expiring saint then kissed her beloved husband and all her other rela- tives who were in that solemn chamber, and bade them adieu with an imperturbable serenity. On being asked, some few minutes after, if she still found her Lord with her, she could only faintly articulate  Yes. At five minutes to three oclock her happy spirit took its departure to the Saviour, so gently, that for some moments her attendants\n\nPage 31\nHOME INTELLIGENCE. 31 rere unaware of the fact. Thus she died, is she had lived,  in perfect peace. Her remains were interred on Saturday, he 10th of November, in the vault in front ¦f Zion chapel, Chatham, in the presence of i large assembly of weeping friends. Of Airs. Stocks character the writer will sot attempt any elaborate description. Her excellencies were too well known to those who had the privilege of enjoying her friend- ship, to render such details necessary for their information, and it is for them principally that this memoir is composed. The writer cannot, however, forbear stating, that, during the ten years of his acquaintance with the dear deceased, he never once saw her betray- ed into a passion, or even into the exhibition of feelings bordering upon such a state. And yet he has often seen her brought into cir- cumstances which were peculiarly trying. Would that all ministers and ministerswives more closely resembled her in this particular! In the social and domestic virtues she pecu- liarly '''\n\nprint('\\n >> Completed!')",
